This respository implements three models described in [Anti-Money Laundering in Bitcoin: Experimenting with Graph Convolutional Networks for Financial Forensics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.02591.pdf).
Models are applied to [Elliptic Bitcoin dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set).

### Models
1. GCN
2. GCN with skip connection
3. EvolveGCN

### Requirements
* tensorflow ==2.4.1
* numpy <= 1.19.5
